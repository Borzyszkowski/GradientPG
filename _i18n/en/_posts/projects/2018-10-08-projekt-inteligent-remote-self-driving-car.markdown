The goal of the project is to build an intelligent vehicle that has two options of control - remotely
 (wireless communication with the computer) and autonomously (the robot is capable to choose the way
 itself, collect necessary information and react for example to road signs, traffic lights and other
 vehicles). The project is based on Raspberry Pi and Arduino, using camera and ultrasonic sensor - data
 between the devices is exchanged in real time. The next stage of development will be implementation
 of the neural network, which will enable objects recognition from the camera and making decisions based
 on their analysis. The project has started during work at the Karunya Institute of Technology and
 Sciences in India and is continued at the Gdansk University of Technology.

Project has open repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Borzyszkowski/Robotics-in-India-Intelligent-Robot).
 In the "Multimedia and Sources" you can find my report and presentation with details about devices
 architecture and connections design.
