In this project we want to explore reinforcement learning techniques in deep learning. Our baseline is experiment presented by Andrej Karpathy on his [blog](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/). His work is about lightweight Policy Gradient agent.

Starting from reproducing his work, we will further develop better agents for common reinforcement learning tasks and eventually start whole new projects based on gained experience. Along the road, articles/presentations for Gradient research circle should emerge.

For more details (also to see our development direction and current work) see our [GitHub](https://github.com/piojanu/AtariAI).
