Nowadays AI agents are highly specialized in solving specific problems. Those models are typically
 trained in separation, without sharing knowledge which is noneffective. Huge amount of effort is put
 into research aiming at transfer learning, that is using knowledge obtained in one problem when solving
 other related problems. Goal of this project is to produce one model capable of solving many related
 problems. We have chosen a set of ATARI games as an example of related problems and the AI model is based
 on Deep Artificial Neural Network. Idea for this project originate from 
 [OpenAI request for research](https://blog.openai.com/requests-for-research-2/).

Project is not publicly available but for this project we've reimplemented World Models on our
 [GitHub](https://github.com/piojanu/World-Models).
