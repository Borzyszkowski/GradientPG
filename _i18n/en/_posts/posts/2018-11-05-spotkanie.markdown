Hello!  
On the next Thursday (08.11.2018) at 18:15 we will meet together at the first lecture that will introduce you to the AI world!

**Place is still unknown!** Please monitor our Facebook page and e-mails sent on Google group.

On the meeting Jakub Powierza will talk about "Machine Learning and Supervised Learning basics". It will be a gentle
 introduction to the problems and maths that stands behind supervised learning. Prepare your computers as on the second
 hour we will work together with hands-on in TensorFlow! Resources will be shared with you a day before the meeting!

Before the meeting we recommend you to recall Linear Algebra basics ðŸ˜‰ It will definitely be helpful to fully understand
 what exactly supervised learning is.

See you!
