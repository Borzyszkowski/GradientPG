Hello!  
We would like to invite you all for the next meeting that will take place at Thrusday,
 4th April on 18:15 in room NE 104. What do we plan to present this time?

## Agenda

 - On the first hour, Wojciech Janowski will tell us what Image Captioning is and
   what are available solutions to this problem.

 - Then, Jakub Powierza would like to present what problems can be found while processing
   labels collected in the crowdsourcing fashion using MedTagger. He will tell us in details
   which unsupervised learning algorithms can be used in order to extract interesting data
   out of it.
