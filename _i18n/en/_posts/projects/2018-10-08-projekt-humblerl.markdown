Straightforward reinforcement learning Python framework. It will provide all the boilerplate code
 needed to implement RL logic (see [diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piojanu/humblerl/master/misc/rl_diagram.png))
 with different publicly available environments and own agents (plus e.g. logging).
 Thanks to power of interfaces, in theory you should be able to exchange different parts of
 RL pipeline without any changes in others (e.g. changing environments and preprocessing).
 It's not a deep learning framework! It's designed to work with them to build agents (e.g. PyTorch or TensorFlow).

Project is available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/piojanu/humblerl).
