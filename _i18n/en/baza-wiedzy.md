## Mathematics for Machine Learning

#### Books
- **[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)**
- [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf)

#### Courses
- **[Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning)**
  You can [audit](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818613-Enrollment-options) each of three courses in specialization for free or ask for [Financial Aid](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid)! The latter is highly recommended.
