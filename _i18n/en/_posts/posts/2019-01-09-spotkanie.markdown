Hey,  
New year has come and so do we! Let's time to meet again! First meeting in this year will take place
 in NE 104 at 18:15 tomorrow (Thursday, 10.01).

### Agenda

 - **Hubert Skrzypczak** will present his implementation of a framework for training neural networks
   codenamed "Onion"! Making such a framework is a great excercise for understanding how neural networks
   works nad are trained. Hubert will also recall all the basics needed to understand his talk :)

 - On the second hour we will talk about **our projects** ;) We will together work out some goals for
   the next two and a half months. Effects of our work will be shown on the "FOKA" event
   which will take place on our university on 21 March. We invite all new and "old" members for
   participation! From now, we will focus on practical side of our activity!

See you! :)
