The goal of this project is to monitor Twitter and other hot-topic sources and their analysis together with stock values. Such
 news could then be processed using sentiment analysis. For example: if everyone posts a Tweet that new Tesla car is crappy,
 we can expect that their stock value will get down significantly.

Such a system might be helpful for market analytics and traders!
