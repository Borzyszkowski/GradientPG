Hey,  
Upcoming meeting will be a little bit calmer than usually :)

### What will we do?

At the beginning Grzegorz Beringer will introduce you to our internal Kaggle competitions, including "Boston Housing" prediction.
 We will present you rules and intentions behind them :) Then, Piotr Januszewski will show you his example solution that bases on
 linear regression.

On the second hour, we will move to the nearby Pizza PRL to integrate together eating pizza and drinking beer :)

See you at 18:15 in EA AUD1!
