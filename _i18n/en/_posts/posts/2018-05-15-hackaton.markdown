Hey,  
Instead of classical Gradient meeting on ETI, we decided that we need to integrate and do something unusual. And all of you know what kind of integration suits well all kind of developers. Thats right, we met with [SKALP Robotics Association](https://www.facebook.com/Stowarzyszenie-Robotyk√≥w-SKALP-404413996671952/) and orginized a hackaton!

## How did it look like?
Hackaton was prepared exclusively for Gradient and [SKALP](https://www.facebook.com/Stowarzyszenie-Robotyk√≥w-SKALP-404413996671952/) members. We met at friday 18:00 in [Domem Technika NOT](https://www.facebook.com/domtechnikanotgdansk/) where we formed teams and ... got to work! :)

Main topic of our meeting was **Reinforcement Learning**. Thats why teams were working on projects connected with AI agents.

Keeping RedBull&pizza fueled hard work aside, there were alot of fun and integration meetings in [Reconnect](https://www.facebook.com/reconnect.gg/) club :) Our 'last men standing' teams were working till the crack of dawn!

## Our teams

Poni≈ºej prezentujemy wszystkie zespo≈Çy, kt√≥re wziƒô≈Çy udzia≈Ç w hackathonie.

### "Space Y‚Äù Team

> The main goal of our project was to develop smart agent that can land rover on the surface of the moon
> 
> Mission turned out to be a success! It was a great time for out team, we were really proud of our solution.
>  There are few videos presenting next stages of agent learning process

### Team "Œ©Go"

> Our task was to teach agent to balance rod on the bogie using DQN in Tensorflow.
> We failed even after some major code fixes, but maybe we can get it work soon.
> Event was cool, pizza + cheap beer is always good. 
> I dont raise any objections... maybe one: event was planned to last to 12am but there were no people left at 2am xD.

 - Ania Malizjusz,
 - Katarzyna Studzi≈Ñska.

### Team "Musk-have‚Äù

> Our project idea was connected with deep learning model used for self-driving car in Unity3D environment. We planned to reimplement model basing on [https://github.com/llSourcell/How_to_simulate_a_se...](https://github.com/llSourcell/How_to_simulate_a_self_driving_car/blob/master/self-driving-car.ipynb)
> Unfortunately we had problems with Unity configuration so team dispersed to help in other projects.

### Team "King Pong"

> We decided to teach computer how to play Pong game! Although we had problems with environment setup (gym[atari]), we managed to create neural network and start learning process. 
> Main strength of our team were Pawe≈Ç and Paula, they were determined to accomplish the task. This resulted in constant progress. A huge help was offered from Piotrek and Micha≈Ç
> in form of problem breakdown and application structure description.
> We learned more than our Pong agent, but still Hackaton was a huge success for us! üïπüçïüçª
