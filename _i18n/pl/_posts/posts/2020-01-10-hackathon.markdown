Let’s face it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the world. It’s changing the way we develop technologies, build businesses and educate ourselves. Gradient decided to start AI Games to eagerly face this challenge and help AI geeks from all around the world build their own visions of our future with AI.

During AI Games your team will have 24 hours to hack your own solution to one of 3 real world AI challenges!
