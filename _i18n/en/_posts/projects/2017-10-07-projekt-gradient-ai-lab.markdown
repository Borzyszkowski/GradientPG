In this project we want to explore reinforcement learning techniques in deep learning. Our baseline is experiment presented by Andrej Karpathy on his [blog](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/). His work is about lightweight Policy Gradient agent.  

<p align="center"><img width="600" height="240" src ="/assets/projects/ai_lab/logo.jpg" /></p>

Starting from reproducing his work, we now go further developing better agents for reinforcement learning tasks we find interesting. Eventually, we will start whole new projects based on gained experience. For more details (also to see our development direction and current work) see our [GitHub](https://github.com/piojanu/AtariAI).
