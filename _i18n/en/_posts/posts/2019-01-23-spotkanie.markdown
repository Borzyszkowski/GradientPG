Hello,  
We will meet again together tomorrow at 18:15 in NE 104!

## Agenda

 - Workshop about semantic segmentation presented by **Paweł Białas**. It will be a live coding session, so please bring
   your own computers! Link to the Google Colab notebook will be sent to you tomorrow, so you don't have to prepare your
   local environment. We hope not to have any issues with Internet connection ;)
 - Then, **Sebastian Cygiert** will present his offer for groups projects and diploma thesis projects.
 - At the end, our top scorers on Kaggle's InClass competition "Boston Housing" will present their solutions and results!
   Each one of them will be able to present a short 10 minutes talk.

### Scoreboard for Boston Housing

 1. Kazimierz Najmajer
 2. Jan Pliszka
 3. Hubert Skrzypczak
 4. Jakub Korthals

Congratulations and see you tommorow!
