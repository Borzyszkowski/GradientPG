Hello,  
On the forthcoming Thursday at 18:15 we will meet again in EA AUD 1 to listen to the lecture and
 take part in hands-on. This time we will look deeper into Recurrent Neural Networks!

Class will be hosted by Karol Draszawka MSc based on resources prepared for
 [International Summer School on Deep Learning 2018](http://dl-lab.eu). Bring and prepare your computer
 for hands-on. Details and instructions for setting up your development environment will be shared
 with you a day before the meeting on our Google Group.

Bye!
