Hello!  
On the next Thursday (08.11.2018) we will meet together at the first lecture that will introduce you to the AI world!

Meeting will take place in EA AUD1 at 18:15. Please do not be late! ðŸ˜€

On the meeting Jakub Powierza will talk about "Machine Learning and Supervised Learning basics". It will be a gentle
 introduction to the problems and maths that stand behind Supervised Learning. Prepare your computers as on the second
 hour we will work together on hands-on in TensorFlow! Resources will be shared with you a day before the meeting!

Before the meeting we recommend you to recall Linear Algebra basics ðŸ˜‰ It will definitely be helpful to fully understand
 what exactly Supervised Learning is.

See you!
