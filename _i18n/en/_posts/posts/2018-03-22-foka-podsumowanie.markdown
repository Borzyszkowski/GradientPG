Hello!
We would like to thank you for your presence at our booth on FOKA (Academic Organizations and Scientific Circles Forum) event. We haven't even dreamed of that many attendees interested in our work! :)

On our booth we had presented three demos:
 - real time object detection
 - musical instruments classification (with live music!)
 - agent playing Pong game

As there were many people interested, our presentation team consisting of six Gradient members were answering your questions. We give you alot of information about our current projects and even give some brief intro to what AI actually is :)

For players of the "Game in Main Building" we presented a simple challenge describing neuron structure. There were no problems with the challange itself, we hope that this knowledge will help you understand how neural networks works.

Don't forget to leave a like on our [Facebook fanpage](http://facebook.com/GradientPG/). See you soon on the next events!
